# Dancing Robot

This is a simple algorithm that is able to let a 3D humanoid robot model dance with different songs that is detected.

Currently supports ten songs (more could be added) with only two movement, there will be improvement on different  and more movements soon.

## Demo (To be continue...)

## Dataset

Thanks to Will Drevo's remarkable work, the song learning and classification part in the dancing robot project was an implementation of his work, [Devaju](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu).

There are ten songs in the 

## Classification
 - numpy
 - scikit-learn (sklearn)
 - librosa
 - glob

## Algorithm


### Humanoid Robot URDF

This is how the humanoid robot viewed in Rviz.


### Movement Capture with Kinect Skeleton Tracking

The Kinect Skeleton Tracking is only for the movement capture for the dancing, it is not mandantory if you are satisfied with the movements I provided.


### Dance

An SVM classifier is trained from the feature vectors to determine the instrument it belongs to.
