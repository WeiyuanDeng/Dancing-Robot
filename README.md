# Dancing Robot

This is a simple algorithm that is able to let a 3D humanoid robot model dance with different songs that is detected.

Currently supports ten songs (more could be added) with only two movement, there will be improvement on different  and more movements soon.

## Demo Video (To be continue...)

The project can be divided into two parts. The first part is song learning and classification, the second part is the dance movement capture.

## Dataset and classification

Thanks to Will Drevo's remarkable work, the song learning and classification part in the dancing robot project was an implementation of his work, Dejavu. For more information about Devaju, please see [here](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu).

## Humanoid Robot URDF

The description of the humanoid robot is written in [humanoid.urdf](https://github.com/WeiyuanDeng/Dancing-Robot/blob/master/urdf/humanoid.urdf).

This is how the humanoid robot URDF viewed in [Rviz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz), a 3D visualizer for displaying sensor data and state information from ROS.

For the test, there are two waving poses.

## Dancing Movements

There are mainly two kinds of dancing movements in the project. One is to hard code the joint state, it is only for test at the beginning; the other is using movement capture with Kinect Skeleton Tracking.

### Hard code movements

### Movement Capture with Kinect Skeleton Tracking

The Kinect Skeleton Tracking is only for the movement capture for the dancing, it is not mandantory if you are satisfied with the movements I provided.
